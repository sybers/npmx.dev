npmx.dev provides a better way to browse the npm registry.

## What is npmx.dev?

npmx.dev is a fast, modern browser for the npm registry. It doesn't aim to replace [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/), but provides a better UI and developer experience for browsing packages, viewing documentation, and exploring code.

## What you can do

- **Search packages** - Quick package search with instant results and infinite scroll
- **Browse source code** - View package source code with syntax highlighting
- **Check security** - See vulnerability warnings and provenance indicators
- **Use familiar URLs** - Replace npmjs.com with npmx.dev in any URL

## When to use npmx.dev

Use npmx.dev when you want to:

- Quickly find and evaluate npm packages
- Browse package source code without downloading
- Check package security and provenance
- View package metadata in a clean, dark-mode interface
- Navigate with keyboard shortcuts
