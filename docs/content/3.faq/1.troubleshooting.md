Solutions to common issues when using npmx.dev.

## Package not found

If a package doesn't appear in search results or shows a 404 error:

1. **Check the package name** - Ensure the name is spelled correctly
2. **Verify it exists on npm** - Check [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/) directly
3. **Wait for sync** - Newly published packages may take a few minutes to appear

## Code viewer not loading

If the code viewer shows an error or doesn't load:

1. **Check package size** - Very large packages may take longer to load
2. **Try a specific version** - Use a versioned URL like `/package-name@1.0.0`
3. **Refresh the page** - Clear cache and reload
